# Udacity - Cloud DevOps Engineer - Capstone Project

In this project you will apply the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

* Working in AWS
* Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building pipelines
* Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
* Building Kubernetes clusters
* Building Docker containers in pipelines

## Decissions

Struggled a bit creating and taking down clusters. For simplicity I decided to keep the same cluster between blue and green deployments.

Named the project poll because of an app idea I plan to persue after submitting the project.

This readme is far from a decent documentation, but the repo may still match the rubric, and that is all I go for at this point.
